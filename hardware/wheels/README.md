## bill of materials
Link to the BOM, substitutions
- BOM: [`wheels_bom.csv`](bom/wheels_bom.csv)
- Substitutions:
  - both 6061T6 and 7075T6 aluminium should work fine for the mounts
  - the [CubeMars AKE80-8 kv30](https://www.cubemars.com/product/ake80-8-kv30-quasi-direct-drive-actuator.html) looks like a possible alternative for the mjbots qdd100
